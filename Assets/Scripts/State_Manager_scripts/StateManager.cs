     * For menus and dialogue (since they can all technically be simultaneously active), they are exhaustively listed as booleans
     *  - note that these menu states will likely have a canvas that handles submenus, but the StateManager will only care abt each canvas
     * 
     * How will things access the stateManager?
     *  - it should primarily be static. Some things necessitate its presence on an intangible GameObject
     * 
     * 
     * For 'Roam State' (or whatever y'all want to call it), feel free to add anything here too!
     * The menus are placed 'over'  'Roam' State, so 'Roam State' never dissappears (unless it wants to), it just has something over it
